                                        Vivekananda was born as <b>Narendranath Datta</b> in Bengali family on 12

                                        <h3>Education</h3> -
                                        In 1871, at the age of eight, his formal Eduaction started. He was an
                                        avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion,
                                        history, social science, art and literature. Narendra was known for his
                                        prodigious memory and the ability at speed reading. Some accounts have
                                        called Narendra a <b>shrutidhara</b> (a person with a prodigious
                                        memory).
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        <p>
                                        <h3>Initial spiritual forays</h3> -
                                        Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to "<b>the
                                                question
                                                which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God.</b>"
                                        He asked
                                        several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come "face to face with God",
                                        but none of their answers satisfied him. At this time, Narendra met
                                        Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God.
                                        Instead of answering his question, Tagore said, "My boy, you have the Yogi's
                                        eyes." It was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying
                                        "Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser
                                        sense."
                                        </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        <p>
                                        <h3>Meeting Ramakrishna</h3> -
                                        In 1881, Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after
                                        his own father had died in 1884. Narendra went to Dakshineswar with two friends
                                        and met Ramakrishna.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                Narendra asked Ramakrishna if he had seen or experienced
                                                God.Without any hesitation,
                                                <b>
                                                        Ramakrishna said: "Yes, I have seen God. I
                                                        see Him
                                                        as I see you here, only more clearly. God can be seen. One can
                                                        talk to
                                                        him."
                                                </b>
                                                Narendra felt amazed, as this was the first time he was meeting someone
                                                who could say that he had met or experienced God.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                The first meeting with Ramakrishna so much puzzled the young mind of
                                                Narendra that he was feeling anxious to meet Ramakrishna again. During
                                                the second meeting, he had another strange experience. When he was
                                                talking to Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna suddenly placed his right foot on
                                                Narendra's chest and Narendra started feeling unconscious, he felt as if
                                                everything around him, the rooms, the walls, the temple garden were
                                                vanishing away. Narendra got scared and became even more puzzled and
                                                felt that Ramakrishna had hypnotized him. But he apparently could not
                                                resist Ramakrishna from influencing him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                Narendra went to meet Ramakrishna for the third time. Ramakrishna took
                                                him to the adjacent garden and touched him. Narendra failed to resist
                                                Ramakrishna's exalted spiritual touch and became unconscious.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                After many such tests, Narendra started accepting Ramakrishna as his
                                                spiritual teacher.

                                        <h3>Founding of Ramakrishna Math</h3> -
                                        After the death of Ramakrishna in August 1886, Narendra and a few other monastic
                                        disciples of Ramakrishna converted a dilapidated house at Baranagar into a new
                                        math (monastery).

                                        <h3>Travels in India</h3> -
                                        In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life
                                        of a wandering monk, "without fixed abode, without ties, independent and
                                        strangers wherever they go". Narendra travelled extensively in India for five
                                        years, visiting centres of learning and acquainting himself with diverse
                                        religious traditions and social patterns.

                                                On 31 May 1893, Narendra left Bombay for Chicago with the name, as

                                        began his speech with "Sisters and brothers of America!". At these words,
                                        Vivekananda received a two-minute standing ovation from the crowd of seven

                                                Vivekananda spent nearly two years lecturing in the eastern and central
                                                United States, primarily in Chicago, Detroit, Boston, and New York. He
                                                founded the Vedanta Society of New York in 1894.

                                                Vivekananda adapted traditional Hindu ideas and religiosity to suit the
                                                needs and understandings of his western audiences, who were especially
                                                attracted by and familiar with western esoteric traditions and movements
                                                like Transcendentalism and New thought. An important element in his
                                                adaptation of Hindu religiosity was the introduction of his "<b>four
                                                        yogas</b>"
                                                model, which includes Raja yoga, his interpretation of Patanjali's Yoga
                                                sutras, which offered a practical means to realise the divine force
                                                within which is central to modern western esotericism.

                                        The ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 15
                                        January 1897, and Vivekananda received a warm welcome. In Colombo, he gave his
                                        first public speech in the East. From there on, his journey to Calcutta was
                                        triumphant. Vivekananda travelled from Colombo to Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad,
                                        Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures. Common people and rajas
                                        gave him an enthusiastic reception. During his train travels, people often sat
                                        on the rails to force the train to stop, so they could hear him. From Madras
                                        (now Chennai), he continued his journey to Calcutta and Almora.

                                                On 1 May 1897 in Calcutta, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission
                                                for social service. Its ideals are based on Karma Yoga, and its
                                                governing body consists of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math (which
                                                conducts religious work). Both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission
                                                have their headquarters at Belur Math.

                                                Despite declining health, Vivekananda left for the West for a second
                                                time in June 1899[161] accompanied by Sister Nivedita and Swami
                                                Turiyananda. Following a brief stay in England, he went to the United
                                                States. During this visit, Vivekananda established Vedanta Societies in
                                                San Francisco and New York and founded a shanti ashrama (peace retreat)
                                                in California.

                                                On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), Vivekananda awoke early, went to
                                                the
                                                monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught
                                                Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to
                                                pupils, later
                                                discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna
                                                Math. At
                                                7:00 pm Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he
                                                died at
                                                9:20 p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda
                                                attained
                                                mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as
                                                a
                                                possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due
                                                to his
                                                brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when
                                                he
                                                attained <b>mahasamādhi</b>. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy that he
                                                would
                                                not live
                                                forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of
                                                the
                                                Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years
                                                earlier.
